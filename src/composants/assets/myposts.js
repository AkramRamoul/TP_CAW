      "I enjoy going to the forests. It is my hobby that I find very exciting. Traveling in forests leaves me refreshed and energized. I find myself close to nature in forest areas. I always like to be part of a nature group to go to a forest. I learn about the trees and animals from nature experts in such groups.",

      "My grandmother was still alive when I was 5 years old and she asked me to check and see if the iron was hot enough yet so I pressed my hand against it and it was red and screaming for hours. 25 years later, she would still sometimes apologize in the middle of conversations, 'I feel so bad about making you touch the iron' shed say, as though it had just happened. I cannot imagine how we forgive ourselves for all the things we didn't say until it was too late. But how else do you tell if something is hot but to touch it?",
